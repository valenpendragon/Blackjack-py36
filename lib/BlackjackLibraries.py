class Card(object):
    '''
    This class is used to simulate a playing card. It is composed of a
    three attributes: rank, suit, and value, where rank is taken from 2 through
    king, suit (also found below), and value is based on the rank, being
    equal to numerical value appearing in the rank. All "face" cards, Jack,
    Queen, and King, have a value of 10 as well.
    Note: Aces are dealt with in a subclass.

    Methods:
        __init__: creates a card tuple using provided rank and suit.
        __str__: prints out the card in Rank-Suit format.

class Ace(Card):
    """
    This class deals with the special case that a card is an Ace. Aces have two
    possible values in Blackjack, 1 or 11. The value depends on whether or not
    the dealer or player would bust if the Ace is considered an 11. This class
    inherits __str__, but needs a separate __init__() method. In usage in game
    programming, if statements, like this one?
        if type(card) == Ace:
    can used to separate Aces from the other cards when scoring hands, etc.

    Unique Methods:
        __init__: Adds an extra attribute reflecting an ace's second value.
