2018-07-05 06:50: First Commit: Added graphics files 

2018-07-05 06:58: Created ./etc with stubs for License, Readme, Change.log, and Documention.

2018-07-05 07:12: Updated the change.log to reflect the initial commits. Pushed these changes to origin/master.

2018-07-05 13:30: Created BlackjackLibraries.py and started laying out in the docstring the major classes that will be needed for this attempt.

2018-07-06 08:00: Created the Card class and its __init__() method. No testing of the method to see if it works yet.

2018-07-06 08:30: Created Card.__str__() method. Fully tested the Card class methods to make sure that they work, including printing out a "hand".

2018-07-06 09:00: Created SubClass Ace and its unique __init__() method. Fully tested this subclass, including using it in conditional statements. Commented the correct syntax to use when checking the type of card.

2018-10-18 19:45: Created Class Deck with preamble. Created __init__() method, __len__() method, __str__() method, __del__() method, and remove_top() method. remove_top() removes the card at index 0 and returns it. All of these methods have been fully tested. Cleaned up notes on Classes Card and Ace. Added constants RANKS and SUITS.

2018-10-20: Cleaned up comments in Class Deck. Removed Deck.__del__() method since all it does is write a message. Corrected all comments to reflect this. Added SubClass CardShoe. Added method CardShoe.__init__(). Fully tested CardShoe and its inherited methods and attributes.

2018-10-21 23:37: Created the Hand class. Hand.__init__() simply creates a empty hand for a player that can receive cards from a deal. Hand.__str__() method with diagnostic option has been added. It is setup for the subclasses, but this cannot be fully tested yet. Hand.__len__() method seems to work, but without Hand.receive_card(), this cannot be fully tested either.
